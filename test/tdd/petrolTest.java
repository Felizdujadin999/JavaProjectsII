//Create a class called PetrolPurchase to represent information
// about the petrol you purchase. The class should include five pieces of information in the form of
//instance variables —>
// the station’s location (type String), the type of petrol (type String), the quantity (type int) of the purchase in liters,
// the price per liter (double), and the percentage discount(double).
//Your class should have a constructor that initializes the five instance variables. Provide a
//set and a get method for each instance variable.
//In addition, provide a method named getPurchaseAmount that calculates the net purchase amount
// (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per liter)
//minus the discount, then returns the net amount you had to pay as a double value.
//Write an application class named Petrol that demonstrates the capabilities of class PetrolPurchase.
